In Java, both single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are used to denote character constants and string literals, respectively. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### Single Quotes (`'`)

- **Character Constants**: Single quotes are used to enclose a single character (a `char` in Java). A character constant is essentially an integer value representing a specific character in the Unicode character set.
- **Single Character Only**: You can only put a single character inside single quotes. If you try to enclose more than one character, Java will throw a syntax error.
- **Special Characters**: Special characters, like newline (`\n`) or tab (`\t`), can also be enclosed in single quotes as they are considered single characters in Java.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  char letter = 'A';
  char newline = '\n';
  ```

### Double Quotes (`"`)

- **String Literals**: Double quotes are used to represent string literals in Java. A string literal is a sequence of characters (including none, making it an empty string) used as a constant value in a program.
- **Multiple Characters**: You can enclose any number of characters inside double quotes, including no characters at all (an empty string).
- **Immutable**: In Java, strings are immutable, meaning once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed. If you try to alter a string, a new string object is created instead.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  String name = "John Doe";
  String greeting = "Hello, World!";
  String emptyString = "";
  ```

### Summary

- Use **single quotes** for single characters (`char` type).
- Use **double quotes** for strings (sequences of characters, `String` type).
- Mixing them up or using them incorrectly will result in a syntax error in your Java program.

Understanding the distinction between these two types of quotes is crucial for proper syntax in Java, as confusing them can lead to errors or unexpected behaviors in your code.
